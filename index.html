		<h1> INFJ <br /> Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging </h1>
		 <p> <Strong> Creative  </Strong>  – Combining a vivid imagination with a strong sense of compassion, I use my creativity to resolve not 
		 technical challenges, but human ones. People with this personality type enjoy finding the perfect solution for someone 
		 they care about, and this strength makes them excellent counselors and advisors. </p>
		 <p>  <Strong> Insightful </Strong>– Seeing through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, I step past manipulation and sales
		 style that appeals to the inner idealist. I can even be astonishingly good orators, speaking with warmth and passion, 
		 if I am proud of what I am speaking for. </p>
		 <p>  <Strong> Decisive </Strong>– I follow through on my ideas with conviction, willpower, and the planning necessary 
		 to see complex projects through to the end. I don’t just see the way things ought to be, I act on those insights. </p>
		 <p> <Strong> Determined and Passionate</Strong> – When I come to believe that something is important, I pursue that goal with 
		 a conviction and energy that can catch even my friends and loved ones off guard. I rock the boat if I have to, something not
		 everyone likes to see, but my passion for the chosen cause is an inseparable part of my personality. </p>
		 <p> <Strong> Altruistic </Strong>– Have strong beliefs and take the actions to advance an idea that I truly
		 believe will make the world a better place. </p>
