		<h1> INFJ <br /> Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging </h1>
		 <p> <Strong> Creative  </Strong>  – Combining a vivid imagination with a strong sense of compassion, INFJs use their creativity to resolve not 
		 technical challenges, but human ones. People with the INFJ personality type enjoy finding the perfect solution for someone 
		 they care about, and this strength makes them excellent counselors and advisors. </p>
		 <p>  <Strong> Insightful </Strong>– Seeing through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, INFJs step past manipulation and sales
		 iting style that appeals to the inner idealist in their audience. INFJs can even be astonishingly good orators,
		 speaking with warmth and passion, if they are proud of what they are speaking for. </p>
		 <p>  <Strong> Decisive </Strong>– Their creativity, insight and inspiration are able to have a real impact on the world,
		 as INFJs are able to follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower, and the planning necessary 
		 to see complex projects through to the end. INFJs don’t just see the way things ought to be, they act on those insights. </p>
		 <p> <Strong> Determined and Passionate</Strong> – When INFJs come to believe that something is important, they pursue that goal with a conviction 
		 and energy that can catch even their friends and loved ones off guard. INFJs will rock the boat if they have to, something not
		 everyone likes to see, but their passion for their chosen cause is an inseparable part of their personality. </p>
		 <p> <Strong> Altruistic </Strong>– These strengths are used for good. INFJs have strong beliefs and take the actions that they do not
		 because they are trying to advance themselves, but because they are trying to advance an idea that they truly
		 believe will make the world a better place. </p>
